# About PayPal Commerce

PayPal Commerce is building a better way to shop on mobile. This means less typing, smarter purchasing, and more flexibility. It means mobile shops that can exist as independent apps, or embedded into your existing apps. You don't have to replace your existing ecommerce platform – we'll integrate on top of it. We currently support Shopify & Magento, and we're actively working on integrating more 3rd party platforms.

We're actively building out this SDK, and we'll be updating this repo on a regular basis. We'd love to hear feature ideas from you. If any bugs have slipped past us, please let us know! You can email us at [commerce-sdk@paypal.com](mailto:commerce-sdk@paypal.com) (it's not a black hole, I swear – it goes to our iOS lead Robert Tolar Haining & other folks building out the SDK). As thanks, we will send you some PayPal Commerce swag.
