# PayPal Commerce iOS SDK
The PayPal Commerce iOS SDK allows you to embed a store directly within your own native iOS app — all with minimal code.


The SDK can be used in a few different ways:
- A standalone iOS app
- A store embedded into an existing app
- Product cards and buy buttons embedded in your existing app, enabling in-app checkout


**PayPal Commerce is currently in closed beta.** Apply to join at [commerce.paypal.com/register](https://commerce.paypal.com/register).


We invite you to:
- Read the [documentation for the SDK on the Braintree Developer website](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/paypal-commerce-ios/overview).
- Check out our [example projects on GitHub](ExampleProjects/).
- Download our example app "[Clothes Shop](https://appstore.com/clothesshop)" from the App Store. It shows off all the features of the SDK.


## What is PayPal Commerce?
PayPal Commerce is building a better way to sell on mobile without changing the way you do business. We give your customers a mobile shopping experience with less typing, smarter purchasing, and more flexibility. We give you a mobile shop that can exist as a standalone app or be embedded into your existing app, all with minimal code.

Simply connect your ecommerce platform and you can process and fulfill orders as you normally do. Currently, we support Magento, Bigcommerce, and Demandware, and we are actively working on integrating more third party platforms.

While we are in beta, you can check out the included example projects, which work with a demo shop we set up called "Dress Shoes." These are connected to a sandbox payment gateway – you can use these [standard test credit card account numbers](http://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/vhelp/paypalmanager_help/credit_card_numbers.htm) to test.

## Communication
[Sign up to receive emails when we release new versions of the SDK](http://eepurl.com/_c1K9). When a new version is released, we will email you, as well as post a tag in the [Releases section](https://github.com/braintree/paypal-commerce-ios/releases) and update the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Feedback
"I was completely impressed with how simple it was to add the PayPal Commerce SDK to the Intelligentsia app. It was a breeze, and there were zero issues getting it integrated into the custom UI, while keeping a consistent user experience."
